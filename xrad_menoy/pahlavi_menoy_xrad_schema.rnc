# This schema is for coordinating multiple editions of a single work across
# Middle Persian (Pahlavi) and multiple New Persian versions. This schema tracks
# these separate versions of the work in separate files, cross-referencing them 
# by section and technical terms.

# Several generations of editors have already divided the Pahlavi version into
# both "sections" (consisting of a theological question and answer) and subsections
# loosely approximating sentences.

# This element is the heart of the research question: how does the New Persian
# version "translate" concepts from Middle Persian? In essence, this is a question

# The <code> element serves as a direct reference to the same position of that
# particular term in a separate document.
